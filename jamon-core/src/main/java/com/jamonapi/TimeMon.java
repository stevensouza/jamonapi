/**
 * <p>Monitor that tracks execution time in milliseconds.  </p>
 *
 * <p>Note due to the fact that when start is called it resets the startTime instance
 * variable and different threads can call start() before one of the threads calls
 * stop this object when used BY ITSELF would not be thread safe.  However, when
 * not reused i.e. when TimeMon's are always taken from MonitorFactory it is threadsafe.</p>
 *
 * <p>I didn't attempt to make this thread safe as even if it was having two threads
 * subsequently call start, start before a stop would reset the startTime and so
 * make one of the callers time off.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note this class is a thin wrapper that adds time capabilities to the basic Monitor
 * class </p>
 * 
 * <p>Note you can get the startTime of this monitor as a Date by calling mon.getValue("starttime");</p>
