   <p>JAMon 2.72 is a minor release.  It now requires JDK 1.5 or higher however.  If you are upgrading from JAMon 2.7 or lower you will also need to upgrade the JAMon war file
   The following is a list of changes in this version:
</p>

<p>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Nanosecond timing is now available</b> - The MonitorFactor now contains a startNano method that times things in nanoseconds as opposed to the default value for the start method which still uses  milliseconds. Note for most performance testing for business applications milliseconds is optimal.</li> 
    <li><b>New Operating System Monitoring</b> - Call jstart/jstop/jadd scripts from your unix/linux/mac host and time and measure aspects of your operating system like script execution time, backup times, cpu utilization, and free memory to name a few. See
           the new JAMon videos on the home page for more information on how OS Monitoring works.</li>    
    <li><b>Monitor skip() method bug fix</b> - The newly added monitor skip method was incorrectly calculated Max active and Avg active.  Both of these were fixed.</li>    
    <li><b>3 New videos were placed on youtube</b> - These videos show how JAMon works.  The videos are each a few minutes long.  The videos are JAMon 101, JAMon reporting, and JAMon operating system monitoring.</li>  
 </p>
 
    <p>JAMon 2.73 is also a minor release.  It has improved concurrency and fixes a regression bug.:
</p>

<p>
   <ul>
    <li><b>ConcurrentHashMap putIfAbsent</b> - Using the new putIfAbsent(key, value) method of ConcurrentHashMap allowed the removal of code that was synchronized every time a monitor was created. </li> 
    <li><b>EJB annotation added back</b> - In a previous release the ejb monitoring annotation was inadvertently removed.  This broke ejb monitoring.  This was fixed in this release.</li>    
 </p>

    <p>Post any other requests you might have on the JAMon support forum.  Better yet contribute code or your time to JAMon!! Happy Monitoring!.</p>
