    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

   <p>JAMon and Aspect Oriented Programming are a perfect pairing.  JAMon can wrap any method call and track concurrency, performance, exceptions and also view the N most recent invocations
       to name a few of the possibilities. With JAMon you can monitor all of your Spring beans using either annotations or by putting a few lines in your applicationContext.xml file.
      This page will give information on how to use JAMon and Spring together. </p>

    <p>It should only take a few minutes to start monitoring all your Spring beans.</p>

    <p>Spring comes with the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/JamonPerformanceMonitorInterceptor.html">JamonPerformanceMonitorInterceptor</a>
    which also allows you to monitor your Spring beans with JAMon.  Feel free to use it if you wish.  The two approaches both do about the same thing. The only difference in the collected data is
    that the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/main/java/com/jamonapi/aop/spring/JamonAspect.java">JamonAspect</a> also allows you to track the
    parameters that were past to the method.</p>
   
    <ul>
        <li><b>Track Specific Exceptions</b> - If the method you are monitoring throws an exception, JamonAspect counts the specific exception (i.e. java.io.FileNotFoundException) </li>
        <li><b>Track General Exceptions</b> - JamonAspect also keeps a total count for all exceptions thrown (the label is com.jamonapi.Exceptions)</li>
        <li><b>View stacktraces</b> - By default JamonAspect lets you view the 50 most recent stacktraces (configurable) that have occured in your application via the JAMon webapp viewer.
            It can also be configured to view the stack traces of specific exceptions (i.e. java.io.FileNotFoundException).</li>
        <li><b>View method parameters</b> - JamonAspect can be configured to display the method parameters used in the invoked method. This is particularly useful in a development or staging environment.
            This is disabled by default.</li>
        <li><b>View method parameters when exceptions are thrown</b> - JamonAspect can be configured to display the method parameters when a method  throws and exception. This is also disabled by default.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note1: It should be noted that it would be easy to change the code in JamonPerformanceMonitorInterceptor to perform all of the above. In the future, I will try to
        work with the Spring team to get them to enhance their code.
    </p>

    <p>Note2: Spring may use the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch08s06.html"> CGLIB proxy mechanism</a>. If so, any class being monitored
        requires a noarg constructor.  The constructor can be private however.  It also requires
     setters for any of the variables that the actual constructor takes (say a 2 arg constructor).  These setters may also be private.</p>

    <h2><a name="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</a></h2>


 <p>There are various ways to configure the JamonAspect to monitor your spring beans.  AspectJ's pointcut language is very powerful and flexible.  It allows you to associate
     an aspect to all classes in a given package, all classes with a given annotation, classes that match a pattern and much more.  You can also choose not to monitor the whole class, and
     instead monitor select methods.  To learn more about aop and AspectJ's pointcuts see <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html">Spring aop</a>
 </p>

  <p>See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/test/resources/minimalApplicationContext.xml">minimalAppplicationContext.xml</a> for a simple example
  of how to monitor a spring bean using a bean name.  See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/test/resources/applicationContext.xml">applicationContext.xml</a>
  for more examples of how to use aop and Spring together.  This file has a number of other ways to define pointcuts that are commented out.  By looking at the file you may see some
  options that might fit your use case.  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/test/java/com/jamonapi/aop/spring/JamonAspectTest.java">JamonAspectTest</a> test class show how these files are used in Spring. </p>

  <p>The next section shows JAMon data generated by executed the test method JamonAspectTest.testMethodsAreMonitored(). </p>

    <h2><a name="whatdoesitlooklike">What does it look like?</a></h2>


   <p>Representative data collected by JamonAspect follows. The screen snapshot was taken from a jamonadmin.jsp in jamon.war.
       Review  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/test/resources/applicationContext.xml">applicationContext.xml</a>
       to see how all methods were selected for monitoring. Note as mentioned in the introduction exceptions are being tracked (com.jamonapi.Exceptions, and java.io.FileNotFoundException).
       All methods were called 10 times (hits).</p>

  <p><img width="100%" src="jamon_spring_aop.jpg" border="1"> </p>
            <br/>

  <p>Here is an example of how it might look like if your application had thrown a wider variety of exceptions.  Note this screen was filtered to only view exceptions.</p>

  <p><img width="100%"  src="spring_aop_exceptions.png" border="1"> </p>
            <br/>

    <p>If the 'modify' icon is clicked for 'com.jamaonapi.Exceptions' you can view the 'FIFOBuffer' which contains the stacktraces.</p>
    <p><img src="jamon_exception_modify.jpg" > </p>
            <br/>

    <p>The following screen snapshot shows what it might look like if exception
        arguments tracking was also enabled. You can see the stacktrace, the method that threw the exception as well as the arguments passed to the method (in this case 1 argument was passed and it
        was a filename: arguments.txt).
