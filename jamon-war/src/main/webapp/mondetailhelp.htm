<h2>Mondetail Help</h2>


<h3>1) General</h3>
<p>mondetail.jsp displays any JAMonListeners that implement the com.jamonapi.utils.DetailData interface.   It is up to the developer
to decide what data to present.  The JAMonBufferListener that ships with JAMon displays the following information
that belongs to the associated monitor:  
<ul>
<li>RowNum - A sequential row number
<li>Label - The detail label associated with the monitor.  Typically this will either be the JAMon summary label (for example 'pageHits'
or a more specific label such as the actual page name (For example: '/myapp/mypage.jsp')
<li>Value - The value of this monitor entry
<li>Active - How many monitors of this type that were opened/active at the time of invocation
<li>Date - The time when the monitor was invoked
</ul>


<h3>2) Output</h3>
<blockquote>Determines the output format for the JAMon monitors.  Options for output are HTML, XML, and an MS Excel spreadsheet. 
HTML is the default.</blockquote>

<h3>3) Cell Formatting</h3>
<blockquote>Indicates how numeric data should be displayed.  Depending on what you are measuring you may want to have decimals appear or
not. Cell Formatting allows you to toggle between precision when viewing the monitors.  The underlying data is not affected - just the view.
Note the com.fdsapi.arrays.ArrayConverter class was used to format the data.  You can also pass any String that is accepted to
DecimalFormat.applyPattern(...)
<ul>
<li>#,### - 1.2345 would show as 1
<li>#,###.# - 1.2345 would show as 1.2
<li>#,###.## - 1.2345 would show as 1.23
<li>#,###.### - 1.2345 would show as 1.234
<li>#,###.#### - 1.2345 would show as 1.2345
<li>No Format - Shows all digits
</ul>
</blockquote>


<h3>4) Filter (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Filter leverages the com.fdsapi.ArraySQL class to query the JAMon data with a SQL like syntax.  
<ul>
<li>If you specify any string within the filter (something like:  com), the string will be used in a Regular Expression to
find any monitors with the given pattern in their label.   This allows you to search for monitors of interest.  Note:  A regular expression is used,
not the more typical SQL 'like' clause (i.e. '%com%').  Also the regular expressions are case insensitive.
<li>You can also enter a full ArraySQL syntax and do more complex queries on any of the JAMon columns.  
Note Strings should be surrounded by single quotes not double quotes. You can use the reports column names as part of 
your query. Examples follow:
<ul>
<li>select * from array where label like 'pageHit' or label like 'mypackage'
<li>select * from array where hits>500
<li>select * from array where label like 'pageHit' or (label like 'mypackage' and hits>500 and total>100000)
<li>select * from array where label in ('bytessent', 'bytesreceived')
<li>Or you can just put in the where clause:  where hits>500
</ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>5) Highlight (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Any text that is entered here and appears in the label column will be hightlighted
</blockquote>

<h3>6) Text Display Length (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>In some cases labels (SQL statements) can become quite large and make the report difficult to read.  By entering an integer in this field
the display of the label column will be truncated to the specified length.  Note this only affects the display and the actual data in the report is not altered.

<h3>7) Links</h3>
<blockquote>Links to various classes from FormattedDataSet API that were used in creating this page.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fdsapi.sourceforge.net/javadocs/com/fdsapi/FormattedDataSet.html" target="_blank">FormattedDataSet</a> - Used to generate
dynamic text
<li><a href="http://fdsapi.sourceforge.net/javadocs/com/fdsapi/arrays/ArrayConverter.html" target="_blank">ArrayConverter</a> - Used to format JAMon
statistics for display.
<li><a href="http://fdsapi.sourceforge.net/javadocs/com/fdsapi/arrays/ArraySQL.html" target="_blank">ArraySQL</a> - Used to query Object arrays 
(Object[][]) that can contain any datatype.
